Hi.  The files (and this README file) listed at the end of this have been 
placed in your  tasks/scala directory to tell you what is required to complete
your Scala assignment in CS3342a Fall 2018 .  I have taken 4 problems of simliar
size from the UCF Programming contest 
  https://lpc.ucfprogrammingteam.org/index.php/past-contests/past-problem-sets
specifically the 2017 contest and practice materials.  Different files have 
been given to different students, so make sure you are working on the ones
that were given to you.  

The task you are working on is
   Problem 4: Cut the Cake!
All the files for that task start with
   polycake
following the same convention, your solution will be in a file called
   tasks/scala/polycake.scala

Case and spelling matters -- remember a computer program will be 
running the initial checks and if it can't find your program in your
git repository in the directory specified by the time specified, then it
is the same as you failing those checks.

The assignment is to implement the task mentioned above in Scala.  Your
entire solution must fit in one file, you are not allowed to use any libraries
other than Scala's core libraries documented at 
        https://www.scala-lang.org/api/current/scala/index.html

You will find sample solutions in C, Java, and Python to help clarify any
issues with the specification given in the pdf file.

Your solution is expected to pass the provided test data which ends with
the suffix .in .  The correct solution ends with the suffix .out .  Your
answer must match exactly so that running a simple Unix diff command
verifies that your output is correct.

Your solution is also expected to not give any warnings from scalastyle when
scalastyle is run with the settings indicated on the wiki .  Furthermore, 
you are not allowed to have in your source code any comments that would cause 
scalastyle to ignore the required style settings.

Finally, the TA will also make a check to see that your solution is reasonable.
For example, that it is a plausibly general solution to specified problem and
that the scalastyle constraints are not gamed, but rather satisfied in a manner
that reveals the meaning of the program.
